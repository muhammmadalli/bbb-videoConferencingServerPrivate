# bbbServerOnUbuntuFocal
Step by step implementation of Big Blue Button video conferencing and remote learning server platform (open-source) on a ubuntu 20.04  focal server. The bbb was also then customized to suite enterprise needs.
#Readymade VM - bbbv1.0
https://sourceforge.net/projects/bigbluebutton-vm/files/

After detailed and extensive attempts to set up server hosting updated bbb-conf using bbb-install.bash (listed below), the engineering team decided to opt for an older version because all newer versions required a FQDN (Fully-qualified Domain Name) pointing to the server, which was not required at all. Infact it was a must for the server to be private.

The steps to deploy the preconfigured VM hosting bbbv1.0 are listed in bbbVM1.0.md icluded in the repo. 

However steps for someone willing to deploy newest bbbServer should read and implement the steps mentioned in bbbv2.7.md - the latest one at the time of deployment.
